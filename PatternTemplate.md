# Pattern Name

## Classification

The scheme:
1. Purpose:
  1. Creational: The process of object creation.
  2. Structural: Deal with the composition of classes and objects.
  3. Behavioral: Characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and
     distribute responsibility.
3. Scope:
  1. Classes: deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses.
     These relationships are established through inheritance, making them fixed
     at compile time.
  2. Objects: deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time
     and are more dynamic. Most are this scope.

## Intent

A short statement that answers the following questions:
1. What does the design pattern do?
2. What is its rationale and intent?
3. What particular design issue or problem does it address?

## Also Known As

Other well-known names for the pattern.

## Motivation

A scenario that illustrates a design problem and how the class and object
structures in the pattern solve the problem. The scenario will help you
understand the more abstract description of the pattern that follows.

## Applicability

What are the situations in which the design pattern can be applied? What are
examples of poor designs that the pattern can address? How can you recognize
these situations?

## Structure

A graphical representation of the classes in the pattern using a notation based
on the Object Modeling Technique.

## Participants

The classes and/or objects participating in the design pattern and their
responsibilities.

## Collaborations

How the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities.

## Consequences

How does the pattern support its objectives? What are the trade-offs and results
of using the pattern? What aspect of system structure does it let you vary
independently?

## Implementation

What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be aware of when implementing the
pattern? Are there language-specific issues?

## Sample Code

Code fragments that illustrate how you might implement the pattern.

## Known Uses

Examples of the pattern found in real systems.
