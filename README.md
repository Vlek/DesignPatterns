# DesignPatterns

## Main parts of a design pattern:

In order to describe and evaluate when to apply a given pattern, I will be using
the criteria that is given in the Design Patterns - Elements of Object-Oriented
Software textbook:

### Name

A one to two word name that describes the solution.

### Problem

This explains the specific problem that the design pattern is meant to resolve.

### Solution

The solution is a high-level, conceptual description without implementation
details.

### Consequences

Includes drawbacks for the design pattern, including reusability, coupling, and
extensibility. This section should go into essentially when not to use a given
pattern.
