# Design Patterns

Design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are
customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context. Meaning,
they are reusable, tried-and-true methods for overcoming programming problems
that developers face time and again that allow them to solve the same sorts of
problems in the same ways without having to constantly reinvent bespoke
solutions.

## Main parts of a design pattern:

In order to describe and evaluate when to apply a given pattern, I will be using
the criteria that is given in the Design Patterns - Elements of Object-Oriented
Software textbook:

### Name

A one to two word name that describes the solution.

### Problem

This explains the specific problem that the design pattern is meant to resolve.

### Solution

The solution is a high-level, conceptual description without implementation
details.

### Consequences

Includes drawbacks for the design pattern, including reusability, coupling, and
extensibility. This section should go into essentially when not to use a given
pattern.
